I have setup the backend for the websitec, with all the required folders according to the instructions. I tested a simple view to render a template and it worked. Hence, the backend is successfully setup. Waiting for the templates to render them.

I also created the model to Job listing on the career page. I'm yet to make migrations and create a view for adding and listing the jobs.

                <h1>What is Dialysis?</h1>
                <p>Dialysis is a medical treatment, or procedure, that replaces kidney function when an individualâ€™s kidneys are unable to function normally.  This procedure involves cleaning the blood of toxins, balancing electrolytes and fluids within the body, and maintaining an overall homeostatic balance within the body.  Dialysis is provided to manage renal impairment, when necessary.  It is not, however, a cure for renal disease, chronic kidney disease, or End Stage Renal Disease.  </p>

                What types of dialysis are available?
            </h1>
            <p>There are two basic types of dialysis, Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis, with some variations within each modality.</p>
            <div class="lists-traitments">
                <div class="list"><i class="fa-solid fa-square-check"></i>
                    <p><strong>Hemodialysis:</strong>  Hemodialysis patients receive dialysis through direct access with the blood.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="list"><i class="fa-solid fa-square-check"></i>
                    <p><strong>Peritoneal:</strong>  Peritoneal dialysis patients receive dialysis through an access placed in the lower abdomen. </p>
                </div>
               <p>
                Each of these dialysis modalities can help patients feel better, leading to overall improved health, and a better quality and quantity of life.  In our swing bed dialysis program, we commonly treat both chronic and acute kidney injury dialysis patients who are in need of rehabilitative or skilled nursing services.  At Prague Regional Memorial Hospital, we are pleased to offer Hemodialysis services currently, with the goal of offering Peritoneal Dialysis services in the near future, for the convenience of our swing bed patients and their families.

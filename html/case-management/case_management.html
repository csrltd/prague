        <h1>Social Services</h1>
        <p>If your doctor or nurse sees that you might need extra emotional support during your hospital stay they may
          place a referral to our social worker. At Prague Regional Memorial Hospital, our social workers provide
          support services that may include:</p>

          <p>The social worker begins by assessing the patient and determining what psychological or social problems
            they are having due to their medical condition.</p>
          <p>After assessing the patient’s needs, the social worker will intervene as needed. Assistance will vary
            depending on the patient’s needs. For example, some patients may need help connecting with services in their
            community, such as a homeless shelter or drug treatment support. Other patients may need help understanding
            their medical condition and navigating everything involved with their hospital stay.</p>
          <p>Any concerns related to the psychological, practical or social well being of each patient or their loved
            ones may be discussed openly with our social workers.</p>

        <h1>Case Management</h1>
        <p>Our case managers ensure our patients receive the highest quality care during and after their stay at Prague Regional Memorial
          Hospital. By helping patients cope with complicated health or medical situations in the most effective way
          possible, case managers assist patients in achieving a better quality of life. Our case manager begins by
          identifying the patient’s goals, needs, and resources. From that assessment, the case manager and the patient
          together formulate a plan to meet those goals.</p>

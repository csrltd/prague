          <h1>Rehabilitation Services</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Prague Regional Memorial Hospital provides comprehensive Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy and Speech-Language
              Pathology services to help our patients return to an independent lifestyle. We approach every patient
              understanding that every diagnosis, every illness, and every injury are different. Our trained and
              compassionate team members value the quality of life of every patient and their caregivers.</p>

            <p>After surgery or hospitalization, some patients require additional care and transfer into a nursing home
              or rehabilitation facility to help improve their physical functioning. At Prague Regional Memorial
              Hospital, we can “swing” you from the hospital into our Swing Bed Program, which includes skilled nursing,
              physical rehabilitation and other services based on your treatment plan.</p>

            <p>
              Even if you were hospitalized elsewhere, you can transfer to the Swing Bed Program at Prague Regional
              Memorial Hospital, bringing you closer to your family.

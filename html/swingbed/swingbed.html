        <h1>Swing Bed Program</h1>
        <p>After surgery or hospitalization, some patients require additional care and transfer into a nursing home or
          rehabilitation facility to help improve their physical functioning. At Prague Regional Memorial Hospital, we
          can “swing” you from the hospital into our Swing Bed Program, which includes skilled nursing, physical
          rehabilitation and other services based on your treatment plan. Even if you were hospitalized elsewhere, you
          can transfer to the Swing Bed Program at Prague Regional Memorial Hospital, bringing you closer to your
          family.</p>

      <div>
        <p>Patients who would benefit from Prague Regional Memorial Hospital’s Swing Bed Program are those who have
          already been in the hospital for at least 3 days but require additional nursing care and/or rehabilitation
          services on a daily basis. Stays usually last from one to three weeks.</p>
        <p>Even if you were hospitalized elsewhere, you can transfer to the Swing Bed Program at Prague Regional
          Memorial Hospital, bringing you closer to your family.</p>
